# python-electric

**python-electric** is a lightweight Python package designed to support the 
conceptual design and verification of low-voltage (LV) electrical networks in
buildings. The library implements fundamental protection principles inspired by
and aligned with IEC standards, enabling engineers to perform:

* Cable sizing
* Overload protection verification
* Short-circuit protection verification (maximum and minimum fault currents)
* Basic current-based selectivity analysis
* Time-based selectivity estimation for industrial circuit breakers
* Earthing system verification including protection against electric shock due 
  to indirect contact

python-electric focuses on **conceptual design and verification** of LV
installations. It is intended for engineers who want to explore, document,
and validate design choices early in the design process, before moving to
manufacturer-specific tools or certified calculation software.

An example Jupyter notebook is provided (`/examples/example_01/ex01_LV_design.ipynb`) 
demonstrating the workflow and the steps that are taken in the design of a 
low-voltage electrical network. This notebook reproduces a worked example from 
the reference book *Laagspanningsinstallaties: technologie en ontwerp*.

The design philosophy of python-electric is to remain transparent, conservative,
and standard-oriented, favoring clarity and traceability over black-box accuracy.


## Limitations

* The model intentionally avoids the use of manufacturer-specific curves.
* Selectivity is computed only in a **normative, conservative** sense.
* Arc-energy reduction, breaker coordination classes, and cascading effects 
  (back-up protection) are outside scope.
* The package currently supports **TN earthing systems** and **IT earthing systems**.
