# python-electric

**python-electric** is a lightweight Python package designed to support the
**conceptual design and verification of low-voltage (LV) electrical networks**
in buildings.

The library implements fundamental electrical protection principles inspired
by and aligned with IEC standards. It is intended to **explore design choices 
early in the design process**.

Typical applications include:

* Cable sizing
* Voltage drop calculation
* Short-circuit calculations (maximum and minimum fault currents)
* Circuit breaker selection
* Basic current-based selectivity analysis
* Time-based selectivity estimation for industrial circuit breakers
* Earthing system verification, including protection against electric shock due
  to indirect contact


## Design Philosophy

The design philosophy of python-electric is to remain:

* **Transparent** – calculations follow explicit and inspectable models  
* **Conservative** – results are suitable for protection verification  
* **Standard-oriented** – aligned with commonly used IEC principles  

The package deliberately avoids manufacturer-specific behaviour and proprietary
curves, making it well suited for education, feasibility studies, and early-stage
engineering design.


## Workflow and Usage

The typical workflow when using python-electric is:

1. Assemble the network topology (busses and connections)
2. Add electrical components to the connections (sources, transformers, cables)
3. Perform verification checks (short-circuit currents, protection limits, earthing)
4. Inspect results and iterate on design choices

Jupyter notebooks are the recommended environment for interactive use. An 
example Jupyter notebook is provided in: `/examples/example_01/LV_design_01.ipynb`.
This notebook demonstrates a complete design workflow and reproduces a worked
example from the reference book *Laagspanningsinstallaties: technologie en ontwerp*.


## Graphical Network Builder (GUI)

In addition to the core library, this repository includes an **optional GUI
package** that assists in **building the network topology** and **adding
electrical components** in an interactive and visual way.

The GUI serves as a **convenience layer** on top of the python-electric API and
allows users to:

* Define busses (nodes) and network connections  
* Add and configure components such as cables, transformers, ...  
* Assemble a complete low-voltage network topology step by step  
* Export the resulting network definition for use in Python scripts or
  Jupyter notebooks  

The GUI does **not replace** the underlying calculation engine. All calculations,
verifications, and design logic are performed by the core python-electric library.
The GUI merely facilitates **network construction and inspection**.


## Limitations

* The model intentionally avoids the use of manufacturer-specific curves.
* Selectivity is computed only in a **normative, conservative** sense.
* Arc-energy reduction, breaker coordination classes, and cascading effects
  (back-up protection) are outside scope.
* The package currently supports **TN earthing systems** and **IT earthing systems**.
