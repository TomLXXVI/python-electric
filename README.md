# python-electric

**python-electric** is a lightweight Python package designed to support the 
conceptual design and verification of low-voltage (LV) electrical networks in
buildings. The library implements fundamental protection principles inspired by
and aligned with IEC standards, enabling engineers to perform:

* Cable sizing
* Overload protection checks
* Short-circuit protection checks
* Basic current-based selectivity analysis
* Time-based selectivity estimation for industrial circuit breakers
* Earthing system verification including protection against electric shock due 
  to indirect contact

An example Jupyter notebook is provided (`ex4_installation_sizing_01.ipynb`) 
demonstrating the workflow and the steps that are taken in the design of a 
low-voltage electrical network. This notebook reproduces a worked example from 
the reference book *Laagspanningsinstallaties: technologie en ontwerp*.

## Limitations

* The model intentionally avoids the use of manufacturer-specific curves.
* Selectivity is computed only in a **normative, conservative** sense.
* Arc-energy reduction, breaker coordination classes, and cascading effects 
  (back-up protection) are outside scope.
* The package currently supports only **TN earthing systems**.
